### TL;DR

Technical writing is about getting the job done. 

Concision respects the reader, saves time and money, and results in beauty.

### Writing docs is like programming

- Every word serves a function.
- Efficiency matters.
- Instructions need to be correct and precise. 
- Good architecture supports clarity and maintenance. 
- Bugs are inevitable. Track and fix them. 

<a name="technical"></a>
### Technical writing is like poetry

- Every word matters. 
- Rhythm matters. 
- Order matters. 
- Formatting and presentation matter. 

<a name="avoid"></a>
### Avoid writing docs

- Fix your code to read like a story: redesign, refactor, rename, comment.
- Fix the UI.
- Make a diagram or short video.
- Cancel the project.

### Write docs that get the job done

- Get (mostly) correct content to users.
- Unless “perfect” saves lives, “good enough” is good enough. 
- Decide up front what is good enough. Usually, 90%.
- Create a one-sentence pitch for your content. 
- Be inclusive and culturally sensitive when giving examples.

<a name="efficient"></a>
### Be efficient

- Know how to spell. Trust the spellchecker to catch what you miss. 
- Know grammar. Because grammar checkers have limits, and people care. 
- Know punctuation. Punctuation marks follow the breath, not the rule book. Mostly.

<a name="concise"></a>
### Be concise

- Only use words that matter. 
- Eradicate jargon and corpspeak. 
- Beware of the [Curse of Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge).
- Edit mercilessly.
- Be specific, certain, practical, and direct. 
- One topic per sentence.
- Eliminate choice in instructions.

<a name="heard"></a>
### Be heard (otherwise, what's the point….)

- Speak to your reader.
- Benefits get readers excited. Your excitement is irrelevant.
- Make your readers feel smart. Nothing is simple, easy, or quick. 

<a name="optimize"></a>
### Optimize tools and processes

- Use the tools that work for you. 
- Minimize contributors. Give each a focused task. 
- Choose one person to make all final decisions. 
- Let one editor unify the content. 
- Simplify your publication process. 
- Only negotiate what matters to achieve the doc's purpose.

<a name="feedback"></a>
### Get feedback

- QA time should be proportional to audience size and doc longevity. 
- Trust your editor.
- Don’t let anyone read it until you are done with the first draft. 
- The purpose of feedback is to improve your document, not to make reviewers happy. 

<a name="publish"></a>
### Publish

- Always attribute art, images, and diagrams. Never use it if you don’t know the origin.
- If you can, get graphics redone professionally. 
- Use callouts and captions to make diagrams translatable.
- Use strong colors and contrast for accessibility. Prefer black on white.
- Choose titles and headings that summarize content.
- Publish where your audience can find it. 
- Crowdsource maintenance.
